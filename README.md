# WearWild

Welcome to WearWild, a CSS-only website project!

## Overview

This project represents my journey in creating the WearWild website using only CSS. It was a significant learning experience that took me 5 weeks to complete. Despite being my first big CSS project, I managed to achieve some things I didn't think were possible. I'm proud of the outcomes, but please note that the actual WearWild website is continuously changing. I won't be updating my version further.
